###LastFlag - Open Transactions Mobile Web Client

###General

This application is a mobile web client / server deployment.  The client uses Ionic, Angular, and Loopback, while the server uses Node.JS, Loopback, and node-otapi (a Node.JS addon for connecting to the Open Transactions client API).  This application allows a mobile web user to quickly create a user account, and then establish cryptocurrency accounts for holding and creating Open Transactions-compliant cryptocurrencies.
